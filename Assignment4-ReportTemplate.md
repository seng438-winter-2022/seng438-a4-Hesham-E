# Introduction
This lab consists of two parts: Mutation Testing and GUI Testing. The first part will allow students to learn about mutation faults in a Java code-base with the mutation testing tool. It will also allow the student to interpret and report mutation scores, which will further allow students to design new test cases to improve the overall test suite quality. 
Part two will focus on the GUI testing automation. Student will use an extension called Selenium and will use that to test web interfaces and compare. 

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class



# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy



# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed


# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
